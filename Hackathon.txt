HACKATHON! WOOO!

You have six hours to create a console application! Work in teams of 
up to 4 (or solo if you REALLY want to)!

Requirements:
    - Must be interactive (i.e., shouldn't just be "dotnet run" and the whole scenario plays out)
    - Must use a minimum of 3 classes (derived classes count!)

Tips!
    - You can actually take user input from the console through Console.ReadLine()
        - Example: string UserInput = Console.ReadLine(); 
          will store the user's input into a variable that you can then use to do things!
